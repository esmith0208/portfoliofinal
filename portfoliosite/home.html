        <p>I’m Emily Smith, a creative and technology enthusiast currently pursuing a degree in Emerging Technology
          in Business + Design (ETBD) at Miami University. I’m passionate about blending creativity, user experience,
          and technical expertise to create innovative digital products and meaningful online experiences. My academic
          background has equipped me with the skills to approach complex problems with a strategic, user-centered
          mindset, always looking for the intersection between functionality and aesthetics.</p>

        <p>At Miami, I’ve had the opportunity to dive deep into the world of digital design and UX research, applying
          those principles to real-world projects. Whether it’s optimizing product ads for brands or
          developing engaging content strategies, I focus on understanding the customer journey and using data to drive
          impactful decisions. I believe in the power of technology to transform businesses and enhance user
          experiences, and I’m constantly exploring new ways to push the boundaries of what’s possible.</p>

        <p>This portfolio is a showcase of the projects that have shaped my journey so far. Each project represents my
          commitment to learning, experimenting, and pushing my skills to the next level. As I continue to grow, I’m
          excited to connect with professionals who share my passion for emerging technologies, design, and creating
          digital experiences that truly make a difference.</p>

        <p>Take a look around and feel free to reach out if you're looking for someone who is detail-oriented,
          innovative, and deeply committed to the future of digital design and user experience.</p>
